# AI Agent Blog Writing Guide for Mirelle Blog System

**Complete guide for AI agents to write blog posts that work perfectly with the Mirelle Next.js blog system**

---

## 🎯 System Overview

The Mirelle blog uses a **hybrid architecture** that splits content into:
1. **Markdown files** (`.md`) - Core content and metadata
2. **JSON files** (`.json`) - Editable metadata (titles, excerpts, tags, images, etc.)

This architecture allows:
- ✅ Easy content editing without touching code
- ✅ Fast metadata updates without regenerating full content
- ✅ In-memory caching for performance
- ✅ SEO-optimized with rich schema.org markup
- ✅ ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) every hour

## 📝 How to Write a Blog Post (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Create the Markdown File

**Location:** `src/content/blogs/your-post-slug.md`

**File naming rules:**
- Use lowercase
