Filing wet nails (weakens and breaks them)
Cutting cuticles aggressively (causes infection risk)
Not sealing the free edge with top coat (chips fast)
Using old/expired products (harbor bacteria)
Pressing too hard while painting (damages nail bed)
Shaking polish bottle (creates bubbles)
Painting on dirty/oily nails (vinegar prep essential)
Not letting layers dry between coats
Using fans/blow dryers to speed drying (causes bubbles)
Soaking nails in water before painting (causes puffing/chipping)
Forgetting cuticle oil aftercare (manicure lifts/peels)
