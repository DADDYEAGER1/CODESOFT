# ABOUT PAGE REWRITE PROMPT FOR AI AGENT

## CONTEXT
I run mirelleinspo.com, a nail trend analysis and inspiration website. I'm NOT a nail artist - I'm a curator and trend analyst who understands the nail industry through data, search trends, and consumer behavior. I want to rewrite my About page to reflect my true expertise while being SEO-optimized and including collaboration opportunities.

## YOUR TASK
Create a complete About page structure with actual content that I can copy-paste into my website.
