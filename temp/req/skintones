✅ CONTENT GAPS vs COMPETITORS
What competitors DON'T cover well:

Olive undertone detailed coverage - most guides skip this entirely or give 1 sentence
Nail polish color connection - beauty sites focus on makeup, miss nail angle entirely
Ethnic diversity examples - guides show primarily Western/European undertones
What to do when tests conflict - leave users hanging with no resolution
2025 AI beauty tool integration - outdated guides don't mention tech solutions
Seasonal adaptation strategies - don't explain summer tan foundation adjustments
Budget-friendly testing - assume access to makeup counters/expensive products
Visual comparison across ALL skin depths - charts often show 3-4 shades max
Connection to overall color theory - don't explain WHY undertones matter scientifically
Inclusive representation - lack of South Asian, Middle Eastern, African, Latinx examples

Unique Angle Opportunity:
Position as "The Most Comprehensive & Inclusive Skin Undertone Guide for 2025" - combining traditional undertone tests with 2025 AI beauty tools, REAL diverse representation, olive undertone deep-dive, AND practical nail polish application (your niche edge!).
