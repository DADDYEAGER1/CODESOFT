Base coat + top coat importance (can't skip these!)
Proper drying time between steps (rushing = #1 mistake)
Cleanup techniques (acetone brush, liquid latex, petroleum jelly barriers)
Non-dominant hand strategies (start simple, practice, accept asymmetry)
Nail health first (proper removal, nail breaks between polish)
Progression path (dots → lines → shapes → detailed designs)
Realistic time expectations per design
Fixing mistakes mid-design
Budget-friendly product recommendations
Practice methods (fake nails, paper, nail wheels)
2025 trending designs that are actually beginner-friendly
Color theory basics (which colors work together)

✅ CONTENT GAPS vs COMPETITORS
What competitors DON'T cover well:

TRUE beginner level - Most "easy" tutorials still assume skill; yours should be literally step 1 for zero experience
Household items emphasis - Others mention but don't lead with "you have these already at home"
Non-dominant hand entire section - Everyone struggles, no one addresses properly!
Realistic expectation setting - Don't oversell; say "your first try won't be perfect and that's okay"
Mistake troubleshooting MID-design - How to fix without starting over
Progression path clarity - Which designs to try in which order
2025 trending designs filtered for beginners - Most trend articles assume skill
Budget angle throughout - Emphasize "total cost under $15 to start"
Short nail specific designs - Most tutorials show long nails
Practice methods before real nails - Using fake nails, paper, etc. to build confidence
Beginner community aspect - Where to share/get support
Time-saving hacks - Busy people need 5-10 min designs
Kid-friendly designs - Parents and kids doing together
Why minimalism 2025 = beginner advantage - Tie trends to accessibility

Unique Angle Opportunity:
Position as "The Only Beginner Nail Art Guide You Need in 2025: Zero Skills, Zero Fancy Tools, Zero Judgment" - radically honest about difficulty, emphasizes household items only, celebrates minimalist 2025 trends as the PERFECT time for beginners to start, includes progression path from absolute basics to Instagram-worthy (but still simple!) designs. Your tone should be encouraging friend, not intimidating expert.
