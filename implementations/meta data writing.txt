# COMPLETE METADATA REWRITING IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT

## YOUR ROLE
You are a metadata optimization specialist tasked with rewriting ALL metadata for the Mirellé nail inspiration website to maximize CTR (Click-Through Rate), SEO performance, and social media engagement using proven psychological triggers and copywriting formulas.

---

## CRITICAL CONTEXT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND

### CURRENT METADATA STRUCTURE
The site uses a **centralized JSON metadata system** where content is stored separately from markdown files:

**Metadata Files Location:** `src/content/metadata/`

**Files You Will Rewrite:**
1. `titles.json` - Page titles (50-60 chars)
2. `excerpts.json` - Meta descriptions (150-160 chars)
3. `imageAlts.json` - Image alt texts (under 125 chars)
4. `tags.json` - Post tags/keywords
5. `faqItems.json` - FAQ schema data
6. `tldr.json` - Quick summary sections

**Additional Files to Optimize:**
7. `src/content/shop-categories.json` - Shop category SEO fields
8. `src/content/inspo-categories.json` - Inspiration category SEO fields

### HOW METADATA FLOWS
```
JSON Files → blog.ts loads them → Page components use them → Rendered in <head>
```

**Example Flow:**
- User visits `/blog/christmas-nail-designs-2025`
- System reads `titles.json["christmas-nail-designs-2025"]`
- Renders as `<title>Your Optimized Title | Mirellé</title>`
- Same for description, image alt, etc.

---

## INPUT FILES YOU WILL RECEIVE

### 1. HIGH CTR RESEARCH DOCUMENT
**File:** `high ctr .txt`

**What it contains:**
- Audience psychology analysis (nail niche)
- 10 psychological triggers (FOMO, social proof, transformation, etc.)
- CTR-optimized title formulas (10+ proven templates)
- Meta description formulas (4 proven patterns)
- Power words categorized by emotion
- Competitor insights
- Reddit/forum language patterns
- Character limits and optimization rules

**YOU MUST:**
- ✅ Apply these formulas to EVERY title
- ✅ Use psychological triggers in EVERY description
- ✅ Include power words naturally
- ✅ Follow character limits religiously
- ✅ Use odd numbers over even (7 vs 8)
- ✅ Front-load benefit/hook in first 5 words
- ✅ Never use forbidden words ("maybe," "stuff," "things," "very")

### 2. CURRENT METADATA FILES
**Files:** 
- `titles.json` - Current titles (need complete rewrite)
- `excerpts.json` - Current descriptions (need complete rewrite)
- `imageAlts.json` - Current alt texts (need optimization)
- `tags.json` - Current tags (review and enhance)
- `faqItems.json` - Current FAQs (optimize questions/answers)
- `tldr.json` - Current TLDRs (optimize summaries)

### 3. CATEGORY METADATA FILES
**Files:**
- `shop-categories.json` - Shop SEO titles/descriptions/keywords
- `inspo-categories.json` - Inspiration SEO titles/descriptions/keywords

**Structure Example (shop-categories.json):**
```json
{
  "categories": {
    "christmas": {
      "seo": {
        "title": "NEEDS OPTIMIZATION",
        "description": "NEEDS OPTIMIZATION",
