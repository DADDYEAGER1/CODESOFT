4. **Short nail emphasis**: Most showcase long nails, ignoring 40%+ of audience with short nails
5. **Mistake troubleshooting**: No competitor has dedicated "what went wrong" section
6. **Polish type comparison chart**: No side-by-side gel vs regular vs dip analysis
7. **Alternative color exploration**: Most stick to traditional red/white only
8. **Tool substitution hacks**: No DIY alternatives for expensive nail art supplies
9. **Video tutorial integration**: Most are static images without motion guidance
10. **2025 trend forecasting**: No one ties candy cane nails to broader 2025 Christmas nail trends
