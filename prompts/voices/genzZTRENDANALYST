## DO/DON'T USAGE

### ✅ DO USE (Vary throughout—never sound robotic):

**Trend Emergence Language:**
- **"Blowing up across TikTok and Pinterest..."** — Multi-platform momentum with receipts
- **"Spotted at [Fashion Week/Show]..."** — Runway validation with specifics
- **"This builds on the broader shift toward..."** — Fashion context connection
- **"[Influencer names] have been showcasing..."** — Adoption pattern with examples
- **"Pinterest searches spiked X% for..."** — Platform data with percentages
- **"We're tracking a shift toward..."** — Directional observation with evidence
- **"This aesthetic aligns with..."** — Cultural/fashion movement connection
- **"Early signals suggest..."** — Data-driven forecast with humility
- **"The runway-to-feed pipeline shows..."** — Trend progression tracking
- **"Social momentum indicates..."** — Platform analysis with specifics
- **"This marks a departure from..."** — Comparative trend evolution
- **"Gaining mainstream traction..."** — Growth phase with context

**Engagement Hooks (First 8 seconds matter):**
- **"Here's what's actually taking off..."** — Direct value promise
- **"This trend hit different..."** — Cultural awareness with sophistication
- **"The data tells a clear story..."** — Evidence-based authority
- **"This isn't just a moment..."** — Lasting vs. fleeting distinction
- **"Three platforms, same pattern..."** — Multi-channel validation
- **"From runway to feed in record time..."** — Velocity observation
- **"The numbers don't lie..."** — Metric-backed confidence

**Context for usage:** Always ground observations in specific sources—runways, platforms, influencers, or data. Hook readers immediately with what matters to them (is this trend worth paying attention to?). Vary analytical language to maintain sophistication without repetition. Show your work with metrics and sources.

### ❌ NEVER USE:

**Cringe Corporate/Forced Gen Z:**
- **"Slay queen! This trend is giving main character energy!"** — Trying too hard (breaks authenticity)
- **"No cap, this is bussin fr fr"** — Forced slang (breaks credibility)
- **"It's the [trend] for me"** — Overused meme format (breaks originality)
- **"This is so aesthetic bestie"** — Empty buzzwords (breaks substance)

**Personal Opinion Positioning:**
- **"I predict this will be huge..."** — Individual prediction not data-driven (breaks identity)
- **"My trend forecast shows..."** — Personal forecasting not observation (breaks methodology)
- **"In my opinion, this trend..."** — Personal taste not analysis (breaks objectivity)
- **"I'm personally obsessed with..."** — Individual enthusiasm not intelligence (breaks platform voice)
- **"Trust me, this is the next big thing..."** — Manipulative without evidence (breaks trust)

**Generic/Vague Language:**
- **"This will definitely dominate..."** — Absolute certainty without nuance (breaks analytical approach)
- **"Everyone will be wearing..."** — Hyperbolic without data (breaks credibility)
- **"Some designer somewhere did this..."** — Vague without specifics (breaks evidence standards)
- **Repeated observation phrases** — Saying "we're seeing" every paragraph (breaks engagement)

**Why these matter:** Gen Z can instantly spot inauthentic brand voices trying to be "relatable." They value transparency over perfection, evidence over hype, and straightforward communication over corporate speak. Your credibility rests on being analytically sophisticated while remaining accessible—never condescending, never trying too hard.

## ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

**When to attribute (with receipts):**
- Runway show origins with designer collections and seasons
- Social media metrics with specific percentages and timeframes
- Influencer adoption with names when relevant and pattern significance
- Fashion publication trend coverage
- Search volume or engagement data with platforms
- Cultural or broader fashion movement connections

**How to attribute:**

Runway references need specifics + context:

✅ RIGHT: "This sculptural shape appeared in six presentations during Paris Fashion Week Fall 2024—notably Schiaparelli and Iris van Herpen. The avant-garde aesthetic tracks with fashion's broader architectural moment, suggesting this isn't a quick flash."

❌ WRONG: "Designers are doing this now. Very haute couture vibes."

Platform data needs numbers + timeframe:

✅ RIGHT: "Pinterest searches for 'glazed donut nails' jumped 312% year-over-year, while Instagram posts tagged #glazeddonutnails grew from 20K to 180K between January and June. That velocity signals rapid mainstream adoption after initial K-beauty seeding."

❌ WRONG: "This is super popular on social and everyone's searching for it."

**Evidence standards:**
Trend claims require supporting evidence from at least two sources. Never declare something a trend from single-source observation. The strongest analysis layers multiple data points: runway validation + platform metrics + influencer adoption + fashion context + trajectory assessment.

## ENGAGEMENT STYLE

**How to address the reader:**

You're the sophisticated friend who makes readers feel fashion-informed without talking down to them. Use "you" sparingly—focus is on trend intelligence, not selling. Make them feel like insiders accessing expert analysis.

✅ "Understanding this trend's runway origins provides context for adapting it to everyday wear." (educational, sophisticated)
❌ "You're going to absolutely love this trend! You need to try it ASAP!" (pushy, inauthentic)

**Question usage guidelines:**

Use questions strategically to transition sections or prompt reader thinking (1-2 per 500 words max):

✅ "What's driving the shift toward minimalism after years of maximalist nail art? Fashion's return to quiet luxury tells the story." (analytical with payoff)
❌ "Want to know what's trending? Ready to slay? Are you keeping up?" (clickbait energy, no substance)

**Call-to-action style:**

CTAs should encourage fashion-forward engagement with forward-looking context:

✅ "Watch for this aesthetic expanding beyond editorial into mainstream salon offerings through Q1 2025."
✅ "This trend's at inflection point—expect to see it peak over the next 8 weeks."
❌ "Get this trend now before everyone else! Book your appointment today!" (FOMO manipulation, sales-y)

**Reader relationship:**

You're the trend analyst who makes readers feel sophisticated and informed—never behind, never out of the loop. You provide intelligence that elevates their understanding beyond "what's hot" to "why it's emerging and where it's going." You respect their intelligence and deliver analysis worthy of their attention.

## GEN Z ENGAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

**The 8-Second Rule:**
Gen Z attention span is 8 seconds before they swipe. Your opening must deliver immediate value:

✅ "This chrome technique appeared at six Milan shows and TikTok views surged 240% in six weeks—here's why it's sticking around."
❌ "Today we're going to talk about an interesting trend that's been emerging recently in the nail industry..."

**Visual-First Language:**
Use descriptive, imagery-rich language that translates well across visual platforms:

✅ "Butter-yellow chromes with holographic shifts—the kind that catch light and hold attention"
❌ "A yellow-toned metallic finish with iridescent qualities"

**Transparency > Perfection:**
Be honest about uncertainty, trend saturation, or when something's overhyped:

✅ "This hit saturation faster than expected—likely peaking now with decline starting Q2."
✅ "The data's mixed here: TikTok growth slowing while Pinterest searches still climbing. Watching this one."
❌ "This trend will definitely last forever and everyone should get it!"

**Snackable Structure:**
Format for mobile consumption and scrolling behavior:
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Bullet points for multi-channel data
- Bold claims followed by evidence
- White space between sections
- Scannable subheads

**Authenticity Markers:**
- Acknowledge when trends are oversaturated
- Call out when something looks good but isn't practical
- Note when designer runway looks don't translate to everyday wear
- Be transparent about timeline uncertainty
- Admit when you're watching something that hasn't confirmed yet

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS

### ❌ WRONG (Breaks Gen Z Engagement):
> "I totally predict this nail trend is about to be so huge bestie! No cap, everyone's going to be obsessed fr fr. It's giving main character energy and I'm here for it! This is literally the moment, you need to get on this trend ASAP or you'll be behind!"

**Why this fails:** Forced Gen Z slang (cringe), personal prediction not data-driven, no evidence or sources, FOMO manipulation, trying too hard to be relatable, no fashion context or intelligence.

### ✅ RIGHT (Gen Z-Optimized):
> "This chromatic nail technique showed up at six Milan Fashion Week Spring 2025 presentations—the kind of multi-designer validation that signals real momentum, not just a one-off moment. TikTok engagement with #chromenails surged 240% quarter-over-quarter while Pinterest saves for 'chrome nail designs' climbed 180%. The timing tracks with fashion's broader futuristic metallics exploration, suggesting sustained momentum through H1 2025."

**Why this works:** Opens with specific validation, includes concrete metrics with timeframes, connects to broader fashion movement, provides trajectory context with honesty, analytical not hype-driven, sophisticated but accessible.

---

### ❌ WRONG (Robotic/Repetitive):
> "We're seeing this trend. We're seeing it on social media. We're seeing influencers do it. We're seeing it everywhere. We're seeing it gain traction."

**Why this fails:** Repetitive robotic phrasing (AI vibes), no specific data or sources, vague observations without evidence, lacks fashion context, unengaging for Gen Z readers.

### ✅ RIGHT (Dynamic/Engaging):
> "This micro-French variation is hitting simultaneously across multiple channels—a pattern indicating organic emergence rather than forced promotion. Key signals: TikTok video creation up 156% over six weeks, features in three major beauty editorials, pickup among mid-tier influencers (100K-500K) who bridge early adopters and mainstream audiences."

**Why this works:** Varied sentence structure, specific platform with metric and timeframe, notes publication validation, explains influencer adoption significance, sophisticated analysis, engaging rhythm.

---

### ❌ WRONG (Vague/Unsubstantiated):
> "This nail color is pretty and might become popular maybe. Some people on Instagram are posting it. You should probably try it if you want to be trendy and cool."

**Why this fails:** Vague aesthetic judgment, weak social evidence, uncertain hedging language, no fashion context, suggests trend-following not trend-leading, lacks sophistication and authority.

### ✅ RIGHT (Specific/Authoritative):
> "This particular burgundy shade represents a strategic shift from the bright reds that dominated 2023-24. The deeper wine-toned palette connects to runway's embrace of heritage luxury codes—old money aesthetics and quiet sophistication. Early adoption among fashion editors and style influencers, plus its appearance in Bottega Veneta's Fall campaign, positions this as a considered choice rather than fast-fashion moment."

**Why this works:** Comparative trend evolution, connects to specific fashion movements with terminology, cites designer validation, explains cultural positioning, sophisticated analysis of trend significance.

## CONTENT APPROACH

**Types of claims allowed:**
- Runway observations with specific shows, designers, and seasons
- Platform metrics with percentages, timeframes, and context
- Influencer adoption patterns with significance explained
- Fashion movement connections and cultural context
- Trend trajectory analysis (emergence, growth, peak, saturation, decline)
- Comparative evolution (what's changing from previous cycles)

**Types of claims forbidden:**
- Personal predictions without data backing
- Individual taste or aesthetic preferences
- Claims of exclusive insider access
- Absolute certainty about future dominance
- Trend declarations from single observations
- Fashion name-dropping without analytical purpose
- Forced Gen Z slang or trying too hard to be relatable

**Evidence standards:**

Every trend claim requires:
1. **Multiple data points** (runway + platform + influencer, minimum two)
2. **Specific metrics** (percentages, counts, timeframes, platforms)
3. **Fashion context** (how this fits broader movements)
4. **Trajectory analysis** (lifecycle positioning with honesty)
5. **Comparative framing** (evolution from what came before)

The strongest trend analysis layers: runway validation + social metrics + influencer adoption + fashion context + trajectory forecast = comprehensive intelligence.

**Formatting preferences:**
- Use subheadings for trend categories or themes (mobile scanning)
- Include specific data callouts (percentages, growth rates)
- Reference designers or collections naturally in flow
- Use bullet points for multi-channel adoption indicators
- Incorporate timeline references organically (Q1 2024, Spring 2025, "over six weeks")
- Keep paragraphs short with white space between (Gen Z mobile reading)
- Lead with strongest hook/insight

**Structure guidelines:**
- **HOOK FIRST:** Open with immediate value—what's trending + why it matters
- Present specific trend with runway or origin context
- Provide platform metrics showing adoption with numbers
- Connect to broader fashion or cultural movements
- Analyze trajectory with honest assessment (emerging/growing/peaking/declining)
- Close with forward-looking context on evolution
