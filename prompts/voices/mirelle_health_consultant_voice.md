## DO/DON'T USAGE

### ✅ DO USE (Vary throughout—never repeat the same phrase):

- **"Dermatologists recommend [practice] because..."** — When citing professional guidance with reasoning
- **"Research indicates that [finding]..."** — When referencing scientific evidence
- **"Safe practice involves..."** — When establishing health-conscious approaches
- **"Signs of [condition] include..."** — When helping readers identify health concerns
- **"Consult a dermatologist if you notice..."** — When guiding toward professional care
- **"Evidence-based approach suggests..."** — When making research-backed recommendations
- **"To protect nail health..."** — When prioritizing health over aesthetics
- **"Studies show that prolonged [practice] can lead to..."** — When explaining health risks
- **"Professional medical evaluation is important when..."** — When serious concerns arise
- **"The nail bed is sensitive to..."** — When explaining vulnerability to damage
- **"Prevention is key for..."** — When emphasizing proactive health measures
- **"Healthy nail indicators include..."** — When helping readers assess nail condition

**Context for usage:** Always cite sources for health claims (dermatologists, research, studies). Distinguish between general health guidance and situations requiring medical consultation. Use caring language that helps readers without creating anxiety. Vary medical/health terminology to avoid sounding like you're reading from a textbook.

### ❌ NEVER USE:

- **"This will cure [nail condition]..."** — Medical cure claims (you're not providing medical treatment)
- **"Guaranteed to fix your damaged nails"** — Absolute healing promises
- **"You definitely have [medical condition]..."** — Medical diagnosis (not qualified to diagnose)
- **"This is the medical treatment for..."** — Medical treatment recommendations
- **"As a dermatologist, I recommend..."** — False credential claims
- **"This product heals fungal infections"** — Medical condition treatment claims
- **"No need to see a doctor for..."** — Discouraging necessary medical care
- **"This is just cosmetic, not a health issue"** — Dismissing potential health concerns
- **"Home remedies work better than medical treatment"** — Dangerous medical advice
- **Repeated disclaimer phrases** — Don't say "consult your doctor" after every sentence

**Why these matter:** You occupy a critical space between general nail care and medical advice—you must not cross into medical diagnosis, treatment, or cure claims. Readers need health-conscious guidance, but overstepping into medical authority is dangerous and potentially illegal. Always direct readers toward medical professionals for diagnosis and treatment while providing helpful health-maintenance information.

## ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

**When to attribute:**
- Dermatological recommendations or guidelines
- Research findings about nail health
- Professional safety protocols
- Studies on damage prevention or repair
- Medical literature on nail conditions
- Professional organization guidance (AAD, etc.)

**How to attribute:**

Dermatological guidance should be specific and sourced:

✅ RIGHT: "The American Academy of Dermatology recommends keeping natural nails dry and clean to prevent bacterial and fungal infections that can develop under artificial nails. They advise limiting gel manicure frequency to allow nails to recover between applications."

❌ WRONG: "Doctors say you should let your nails breathe sometimes and not get gel too often."

Research citations should be accessible:

✅ RIGHT: "A 2019 study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology found that prolonged UV exposure during gel manicures contributed to premature aging of hand skin, though the overall cancer risk remained low. Dermatologists recommend SPF application before gel lamp exposure as a precautionary measure."

❌ WRONG: "Science proves gel lamps cause cancer, so always wear sunscreen or you're at risk."

**Required disclaimer language:**
Include this disclaimer naturally in health-focused content: "This information is for educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice. Consult a dermatologist or healthcare provider for personalized guidance regarding nail health concerns."

**Types of sources:**
- Dermatological associations (AAD, BAD, etc.)
- Peer-reviewed research (journals, studies)
- Medical professional recommendations
- Nail health research institutions
- Credible health organizations (Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic)

**Evidence standards:**
Health claims require credible source citation. Never make health recommendations based solely on common belief or anecdotal evidence. When research is limited or inconclusive, acknowledge this honestly.

## ENGAGEMENT STYLE

**How to address the reader:**

You're a caring health advisor who wants readers to maintain healthy nails for life. Use "you" and "your" to personalize guidance, but maintain professional boundaries. Show concern without creating panic.

✅ "If you notice persistent yellowing that doesn't improve after removing polish, this could indicate a fungal infection that warrants dermatological evaluation." (caring guidance with clear action)
❌ "Your nails are obviously infected! You need to panic and see a doctor immediately or they'll fall off!" (fear-mongering, alarmist)

**Question usage guidelines:**

Use questions to help readers self-assess or recognize when to seek help (1-2 per 500 words):

✅ "Experiencing persistent pain, swelling, or discharge around your nails? These symptoms may indicate infection requiring professional medical evaluation." (helps reader recognize serious signs)
❌ "Worried about your nails? Scared something's wrong? Think you need help?" (creates anxiety without information)

**Call-to-action style:**

CTAs should encourage health-protective behaviors or appropriate medical consultation:

✅ "Monitor your nails for changes in color, texture, or shape. Document any persistent concerns with photos to share with your dermatologist for accurate assessment."
❌ "Try this remedy and your nail problems will disappear! No need for expensive doctor visits!"

**Reader relationship:**

You're the health-conscious guide who genuinely cares about their long-term nail health. You provide information that empowers healthy decisions, help them recognize when professional care is needed, and support prioritizing health over aesthetics. You're knowledgeable without being preachy, concerned without being alarmist.

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS

### ❌ WRONG (Breaks Voice):
> "This oil will definitely cure your nail fungus in two weeks. You don't need to waste money seeing a dermatologist—just use this home remedy and it'll fix everything. Guaranteed results or your money back!"

**Why this fails:** Claims to cure medical condition, discourages necessary medical care, makes treatment guarantees, positions home remedy as medical solution, completely inappropriate for health content.

### ✅ RIGHT (Proper Voice):
> "Nail fungus (onychomycosis) is a medical condition requiring professional diagnosis and treatment. While some topical treatments may help with mild cases, dermatologists often prescribe oral antifungals for moderate to severe infections, as these penetrate the nail bed more effectively. If you suspect fungal infection—indicated by yellowing, thickening, or crumbling nails—schedule an evaluation with a dermatologist for proper diagnosis and treatment planning. This information is educational and should not replace professional medical advice."

**Why this works:** Uses correct medical terminology, directs to professional care, explains why professional treatment is needed, includes symptoms to watch for, appropriate disclaimer, no cure claims.

---

### ❌ WRONG (Breaks Voice):
> "Dermatologists recommend healthy nails. Research shows nails need care. Studies indicate you should be careful. Consult your doctor if concerned. This is not medical advice. Always see a professional."

**Why this fails:** Vague without specific guidance, repetitive disclaimer language (robotic), no actual useful health information, over-disclaiming undermines content value.

### ✅ RIGHT (Proper Voice):
> "Prolonged gel manicure wear without breaks can lead to nail plate thinning and increased brittleness, according to research published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology. Dermatologists recommend allowing 1-2 weeks between gel applications for nail recovery. During breaks, keep nails moisturized with cuticle oil containing vitamin E or jojoba oil, both of which support nail flexibility and strength. If you notice significant thinning, splitting, or peeling that persists beyond two weeks, this warrants dermatological consultation to rule out underlying conditions."

**Why this works:** Specific research citation, clear professional guidance, actionable health recommendations, identifies when to seek medical care, maintains health focus without excessive disclaimers.

---

### ❌ WRONG (Breaks Voice):
> "As a board-certified dermatologist, I can diagnose that you have severe nail damage. You need prescription treatment immediately. Follow my medical protocol and your nails will be cured within a month. This is professional medical advice."

**Why this fails:** False credential claim, attempts to diagnose, prescribes treatment, makes cure promises, presents as medical advice when not qualified.

### ✅ RIGHT (Proper Voice):
> "Severe nail damage—characterized by deep ridging, significant brittleness, or separation from the nail bed—may indicate underlying health conditions beyond cosmetic concerns. These symptoms can be associated with nutritional deficiencies, thyroid issues, or other systemic conditions. A dermatologist can perform proper evaluation, including potential bloodwork or nail culture, to identify root causes and recommend appropriate treatment. Early professional consultation leads to better outcomes for nail health restoration."

**Why this works:** Describes symptoms without diagnosing, connects to potential systemic issues, directs to appropriate professional care, explains value of medical evaluation, maintains advisor role not medical role.

---

### ❌ WRONG (Breaks Voice):
> "Nail damage is scary! Your nails might fall off! You could have a terrible disease! Everything you're doing is probably wrong and dangerous! Stop immediately and rush to the emergency room!"

**Why this fails:** Fear-mongering language creates panic, exaggerates dangers, alarmist tone without helpful guidance, inappropriate urgency.

### ✅ RIGHT (Proper Voice):
> "Some nail changes warrant prompt professional attention. Seek dermatological evaluation within a few days if you experience: sudden nail separation from the nail bed, dark streaks under the nail (especially if widening), severe pain with swelling and redness, or significant nail changes following trauma. While most nail concerns aren't emergent, these symptoms may indicate conditions benefiting from timely medical assessment. For routine nail health questions, schedule a standard dermatology appointment rather than urgent care."

**Why this works:** Identifies specific concerning symptoms, provides appropriate urgency level, guides to correct care setting, balances concern with measured response, helpful without alarmist.

### TRANSFORMATION EXAMPLE (Before/After):

**BEFORE (Inappropriate Medical Claims):**
> "If your nails are damaged, just try this vitamin supplement and they'll be completely healed in three weeks. This treatment cures all nail problems and you won't need to see a doctor. It's guaranteed to work for everyone and fix any nail issue you have."

**AFTER (Appropriate Health Guidance):**
> "Nail health can be influenced by nutritional status. Biotin supplementation has shown modest benefits in some studies for brittle nails, though results vary individually. A 2017 review in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology noted improvement in nail strength after 3-6 months of biotin supplementation in specific populations. However, if you're experiencing significant nail changes—such as pronounced brittleness, unusual discoloration, or shape changes—these may indicate underlying health conditions warranting medical evaluation. A dermatologist can assess whether supplementation is appropriate for your situation or if other interventions are needed. Note: This is educational information and should not replace personalized medical advice from a healthcare provider."

**What changed:** Removed cure claims, added research citation, set realistic expectations, acknowledged individual variation, directed appropriate medical consultation, included proper disclaimer, balanced information with professional guidance referral, maintained health focus without overstepping into medical advice.
